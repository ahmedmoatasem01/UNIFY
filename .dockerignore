# ============================================
# Docker Ignore File - Project Root
# ============================================
# This file is used because the Docker build context is set to the project root (..)
# in deployment/docker-compose.yml. Docker looks for .dockerignore in the build context.
# 
# The deployment/.dockerignore file has been removed to avoid confusion.
# ============================================

# ============================================
# Python Cache and Compiled Files
# ============================================
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
*.so
*.egg
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/
.Python

# Why: Python bytecode and compiled extensions are platform-specific and will be
# regenerated in the container. Including them increases image size unnecessarily
# and can cause compatibility issues.

# ============================================
# Virtual Environments
# ============================================
venv/
env/
ENV/
.venv/
.ENV/
virtualenv/

# Why: Virtual environments contain platform-specific binaries and are not needed
# in Docker images. Dependencies are installed via requirements.txt during build.

# ============================================
# Development Database Files
# ============================================
*.db
*.sqlite
*.sqlite3
*.db-journal
*.db-wal
*.db-shm

# Why: Development databases should not be included in production images.
# Database files should be persisted via Docker volumes, not baked into the image.

# ============================================
# Test Files and Directories
# ============================================
tests/
test_*.py
*_test.py
pytest.ini
.pytest_cache/
.coverage
.coverage.*
htmlcov/
.tox/
.hypothesis/

# Why: Test files are not needed in production containers. They increase image size
# and may expose test data or credentials. Tests should run in CI/CD, not production.

# ============================================
# Documentation (except README)
# ============================================
docs/
*.md
!README.md
*.pdf
*.txt
!requirements.txt
!deployment/requirements.txt

# Why: Documentation files (markdown, PDFs, etc.) are not needed at runtime and
# increase image size. README.md is kept for reference. Requirements files are
# needed for dependency installation.

# ============================================
# IDE and Editor Files
# ============================================
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~
.DS_Store
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace
.project
.classpath
.settings/

# Why: IDE configuration files are editor-specific and not needed in containers.
# They can also contain local paths and settings that don't apply to production.

# ============================================
# Version Control
# ============================================
.git/
.gitignore
.gitattributes
.gitmodules

# Why: Git history is not needed in Docker images and significantly increases size.
# Version control should be handled outside the container.

# ============================================
# Environment and Configuration Files
# ============================================
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
ENV_TEMPLATE.txt
*.local
*.secret

# Why: Environment files may contain sensitive credentials and should be provided
# at runtime via docker-compose or environment variables, not baked into the image.
# .env.example is kept as a template.

# ============================================
# Log Files
# ============================================
*.log
logs/
*.log.*

# Why: Log files should be written to volumes or stdout/stderr in containers,
# not included in the image. Old logs would bloat the image unnecessarily.

# ============================================
# User Uploads and Data
# ============================================
src/uploads/
src/data/
!src/data/Schedule 2025.xlsx

# Why: User uploads and runtime data should be persisted via Docker volumes,
# not included in the image. The Excel schedule file is kept if needed for
# initial data import, but runtime uploads should be excluded.

# ============================================
# Temporary and Cache Files
# ============================================
*.tmp
*.temp
*.bak
*.backup
*.cache
.cache/
tmp/
temp/

# Why: Temporary files are not needed and can cause issues if stale data is
# included in the image.

# ============================================
# OS-Specific Files
# ============================================
Thumbs.db
.DS_Store
.directory
*.orig

# Why: OS-specific metadata files (Windows thumbnails, macOS metadata) are not
# needed in Linux containers and can cause issues.

# ============================================
# Deployment and CI/CD Files
# ============================================
.dockerignore
docker-compose*.yml
!deployment/docker-compose.yml
Dockerfile*
!deployment/Dockerfile
.github/
.gitlab-ci.yml
.travis.yml
Jenkinsfile

# Why: CI/CD configuration files are not needed in the container. Dockerfile
# and docker-compose.yml in deployment/ are kept as they may be referenced.
# Note: .dockerignore itself is needed during build but won't be copied.

# ============================================
# Development and Analysis Files
# ============================================
PRODUCTION_READINESS_ANALYSIS.md
FACTORY_PATTERN_*.md
*_ANALYSIS.md
*_REQUIREMENTS.txt
*_QUESTIONS.md

# Why: Development analysis documents and requirement files are not needed
# in production containers.

# ============================================
# Model Files (if large, consider excluding)
# ============================================
# Uncomment if AI models are downloaded separately or stored externally
# *.bin
# *.pt
# *.pth
# models/
# checkpoints/

# Why: AI model files can be very large (GBs). If models are downloaded at
# runtime or stored externally, exclude them from the image to reduce size.
# Keep commented if models are needed in the image.

# ============================================
# Node.js (if any frontend build tools)
# ============================================
node_modules/
npm-debug.log
yarn-error.log
package-lock.json
yarn.lock

# Why: If there are any Node.js dependencies, they should be built separately
# or excluded if not needed in the Python container.

# ============================================
# Jupyter Notebooks
# ============================================
*.ipynb
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Why: Jupyter notebooks are for development/analysis and not needed in production.

# ============================================
# Coverage and Testing Reports
# ============================================
.coverage
coverage.xml
*.cover
.hypothesis/
.pytest_cache/

# Why: Test coverage reports are generated during testing and not needed in
# production containers.
